### About Me

I am a recent Ph.D. graduate focusing on the convergence of early human neural development and tRNA dynamics. My work has delved into the intricate patterns of hominid evolution through cutting-edge T2T genomics, creating comprehensive analytical tools. A lifelong passion for science has fueled my pursuit of a thorough, multidisciplinary education, culminating in advanced expertise in biology, computer science, and engineering. My commitment to research is reflected in my accolades, including multiple poster awards at scientific conferences. I pride myself on my strong computational analysis capabilities and proficiency in machine learning, which are the cornerstones of my bioinformatics approach.
